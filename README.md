## Why Vagrant?
Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.

To achieve its magic, Vagrant stands on the shoulders of giants. Machines are provisioned on top of VirtualBox, VMware or AWS. Then, industry-standard provisioning tools such as shell scripts, Chef, or Puppet can automatically install and configure software on the virtual machine.
